# Apigee Edge XOP Editor

This repo previously contained the Java source code and pom.xml file required to
build a Java callout that edits a multipart/related payload with a
[XOP](https://www.w3.org/TR/xop10/#xop_include) message payload.

The code has since been migrated to [a new
repo](https://github.com/DinoChiesa/Apigee-Java-XOP-Handler).
